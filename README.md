3. ONLY AFTER your project is FULLY complete make a pull request or MERGE WITH THE PERMISSION OF PROJECT OWNER which is @Kithupa or @Nimuthu
4. Other than that just push your changes to YOUR branch and you should be good.

# Right now the people assigned to these roles below don't have any buisness medelling with the project
- Yashitha Nadeeshan
- Dehemi Fabbio
- Dinan Joesph
- Sanduni
- Shenu

the above people don't need to do anything currently and must await until the design is fully complete and merged into the main branch, however Shenu & Sanduni after finishing their documents will have to upload them to the "Documents" folder, same goes to Yashitha and Dehemi after completeing the ER Diagram upload the .SQL & .MWB file into the "Documents" folder

Other than that the people who have to make changes RIGHT NOW are Nimuthu, Kithupa, Dehemmi & Yashitha with full design files, and ER Diagram, later be joined with Sanduni and Shenu with the full documents and UML Diagrams. Then ALL OF US will continue with bringing this application to life.
